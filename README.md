# SurfsUp_Analysis: Shop Opening Analysis
 
 
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to see if opening a shop selling surfboards and ice cream in Oahu is a viable option since both activities require a warm environment to flourish. We will compare the temperatures from the winter month December and the summer month June to see if opening a shop is a viable year round option.

## Summary
Based on the information gathered, we know that overall the temperature is 3-4&deg;F lower in December vs June. On the National Center for Environmental Information website we can see that most people feel comfortable swimming between the ranges of 70&deg;F and 78&deg;F, both our averages are well within this range, almost to the 75th percentile for both. Opening up an ice cream and surf shop is a viable option in this location.
